2013, 2014. This dataset is a de-identified summary table of prevalence rates for vision and eye health data indicators from the Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) data. Medicaid MAX are a set of de-identified person-level data files with information on Medicaid eligibility, service utilization, diagnoses, and payments. The MAX data contain a convenience sample of claims processed by Medicaid and Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) fee for service and managed care plans.  Not all states are included in MAX in all years, and as of November 2019, 2014 data is the latest available.  Prevalence estimates are stratified by all available combinations of age group, gender, and state.  Detailed information on VEHSS Medicare analyses can be found on the VEHSS Medicaid MAX webpage (cdc.gov/visionhealth/vehss/data/claims/medicaid.html). Information on available Medicare claims data can be found on the ResDac website (www.resdac.org). The VEHSS Medicaid MAX dataset was last updated November 2019.
