Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) for the years 1999–2000, 2001–2002, 2003–2004, 2005–2006, 2007–2008, 2009–2010, 2011–2012, 2013–2014, 2015–2016, and 2017–2018 were used for these analyses.

The survey consists of interviews conducted in participants’ homes and standardized physical examinations, including a blood draw, conducted in mobile examination centers.
