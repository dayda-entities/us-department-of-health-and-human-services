2013-2018. This dataset is a de-identified summary table of vision and eye health data indicators from BRFSS, stratified by all available combinations of age group, race/ethnicity, gender, risk factor and state. BRFSS is a system of telephone surveys conducted by CDC that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. BRFSS completes more than 400,000 adult interviews each year across 50 states, the District of Columbia, and three U.S. territories. BRFSS data for VEHSS includes one question from the core component related to Visual Function. Data were suppressed following NCHS standards. Data will be updated as it becomes available. Detailed information on VEHSS BRFSS analyses can be found on the VEHSS BRFSS webpage (link). General information about BRFSS can be found on the BRFSS website (https://www.cdc.gov/brfss). The VEHSS BRFSS dataset was last updated in November 2019.
