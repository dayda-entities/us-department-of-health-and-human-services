ONC established the SHARP program to support innovative research and to address well-documented problems that impede the adoption and use of health IT. The program covers four subject areas managed by four distinct project groups: health IT security (SHARPS), patient-centered cognitive support (SHARPc), health care application and network design (SMART), and secondary use of EHR information (SHARPn). This dataset provides the full inventory of project outputs from the SHARP program, ranging from presentations and manuscripts to APIs and software.
