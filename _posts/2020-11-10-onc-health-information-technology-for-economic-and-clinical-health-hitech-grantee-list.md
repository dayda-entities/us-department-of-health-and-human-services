The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act was passed as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to invest in the U.S. health IT infrastructure. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC) received over $2 billion of these HITECH funds, which was granted to health and community organizations across the U.S. This data set provides the full list of ONC's HITECH Act grantees. The data encompasses the five ONC HITECH Act programs: the Beacon Communities Program, the Health IT Regional Extension Centers Program, the Health IT Workforce Programs, the State Health Information Exchange Program, and the Strategic Health IT Advanced Research Projects (SHARP) Program. This data set includes geographic, federal funding, and grantee organization data. The data can be linked to other open data sets on the Health IT Dashboard and other sources.
