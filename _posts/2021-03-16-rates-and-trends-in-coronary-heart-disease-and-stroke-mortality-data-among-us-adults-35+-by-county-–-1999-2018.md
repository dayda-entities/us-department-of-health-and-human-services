This dataset documents rates and trends in local coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke death rates. Specifically, this report presents county (or county equivalent) estimates of stroke and CHD death rates in 1999-2018 and trends during three intervals (1999-2005, 2005-2011, 2011-2018) by age group (ages 35–64 and 65 and older). The rates and trends were estimated using a Bayesian spatiotempotal model and a smoothed over space, time, and age group. Rates are age-standardized. Data source: National Vital Statistics System.
