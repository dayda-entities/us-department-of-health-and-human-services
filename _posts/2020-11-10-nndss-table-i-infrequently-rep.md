NNDSS - Table I. infrequently reported notifiable diseases - 2018. In this Table, provisional cases of selected infrequently reported notifiable diseases (<1,000 cases reported during the preceding year) are displayed.  This tables excludes U.S. territories.

Notice:  The case counts for Haemophilus influenzae, invasive disease Nontypeable" and "Non-b serotype" were switched for 2018 weeks 1-52.

Note:
These are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistic web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up.  Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.


Footnote:
—: No reported cases. N: Not reportable. NA: Not available. NN: Not Nationally Notifiable. NP: Nationally notifiable but not published. Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts. 

* Case counts for reporting years 2017 and 2018 are provisional and subject to change. Data for years 2013 through 2016 are finalized. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf.  

† This table does not include cases from the U.S. territories. 

§ Calculated by summing the incidence counts for the current week, the 2 weeks preceding the current week, and the 2 weeks following the current week, for a total of 5 preceding years. Additional information is available at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/5yearweeklyaverage.pdf.

¶ Not reportable in all jurisdictions. Data from states where the condition is not reportable are excluded from this table, except for the arboviral diseases and influenza-associated pediatric mortality. Reporting exceptions are available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/downloads.html.

** Please refer to the CDC WONDER for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition.   

†† Please refer to the CDC WONDER for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition.  

§§ Novel influenza A virus infections are human infections with influenza A viruses that are different from currently circulating human seasonal influenza viruses. With the exception of one avian lineage influenza A (H7N2) virus, all novel influenza A virus infections reported to CDC since 2013 have been variant influenza viruses.

¶¶ Prior to 2018, cases of paratyphoid fever were included with salmonellosis cases (see Table II). 

*** Prior to 2015, CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) did not receive electronic data about incident cases of specific viral hemorrhagic fevers; instead data were collected in aggregate as "viral hemorrhagic fevers'. NNDSS was updated beginning in 2015 to receive data for each of the viral hemorrhagic fevers listed.
