<br>The following dataset provides state-aggregated data for hospital utilization. These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across two main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, and (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities.</br>

<br>The file will be updated daily and provides the latest values reported by each facility within the last four days. This allows for a more comprehensive picture of the hospital utilization within a state by ensuring a hospital is represented, even if they miss a single day of reporting.</br>

<br>No statistical analysis is applied to account for non-response and/or to account for missing data.</br>

<br>The below table displays one value for each field (i.e., column). Sometimes, reports for a given facility will be provided to both HHS TeleTracking and HHS Protect. When this occurs, to ensure that there are not duplicate reports, deduplication is applied: specifically, HHS selects the TeleTracking record provided directly by the facility over the state-provided data to HHS Protect.</br>
