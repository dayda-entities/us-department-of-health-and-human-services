State and territorial executive orders, administrative orders, resolutions, and proclamations are collected from government websites and cataloged and coded using Microsoft Excel by one coder with one or more additional coders conducting quality assurance.

Data were collected to determine when restaurants in states and territories were subject to closing and reopening requirements through executive orders, administrative orders, resolutions, and proclamations for COVID-19. Data can be used to determine when restaurants in states and territories were subject to closing and reopening requirements through executive orders, administrative orders, resolutions, and proclamations for COVID-19. Data consists exclusively of state and territorial orders, many of which apply to specific counties within their respective state or territory; therefore, data is broken down to the county level.

These data are derived from publicly available state and territorial executive orders, administrative orders, resolutions, and proclamations (“orders”) for COVID-19 that expressly close or reopen restaurants found by the CDC, COVID-19 Community Intervention & Critical Populations Task Force, Monitoring & Evaluation Team, Mitigation Policy Analysis Unit, and the CDC, Center for State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial Support, Public Health Law Program from March 11 through December 31, 2020.  These data will be updated as new orders are collected. Any orders not available through publicly accessible websites are not included in these data. Only official copies of the documents or, where official copies were unavailable, official press releases from government websites describing requirements were coded; news media reports on restrictions were excluded. Recommendations not included in an order are not included in these data. Effective and expiration dates were coded using only the date provided; no distinction was made based on the specific time of the day the order became effective or expired. These data do not necessarily represent an official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
