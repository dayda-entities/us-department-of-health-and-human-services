This data was collected by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT in coordination with Clinovations and the George Washington University Milken Institute of Public Health. ONC and its partners collected the data through research of state government and health information organization websites. The dataset provides policy and law details for four distinct policies or laws, and, where available, hyperlinks to official state records or websites. These four policies or laws are: 1) State Health Information Exchange (HIE) Consent Policies; 2) State-Sponsored HIE Consent Policies; 3) State Laws Requiring Authorization to Disclose Mental Health Information for Treatment, Payment, and Health Care Operations (TPO); and 4) State Laws that Apply a Minimum Necessary Standard to Treatment Disclosures of Mental Health Information.
