The ONC Regional Extension Centers (REC) Program provides assistance to health care providers to adopt and meaningfully use certified EHR technology. The program, funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) or The Recovery Act, provides grants to organizations, Regional Extension Centers, that assist providers directly in the organization's region. There are 62 unique RECs across the United States. This data set provides federal funding granted to each REC, each REC's program goals, and various metrics on the total providers that have signed up with an REC for assistance, gone live on an EHR, and demonstrated meaningful use of certified EHR technology. This data set is an artifact of ONC's performance measurement and data analysis during the life of ARRA. RECs continue to assist providers to go live and demonstrate meaningful use of EHRs. See ONC's other REC data to track these metrics at the state and county level.
