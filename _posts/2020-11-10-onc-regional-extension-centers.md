The ONC Regional Extension Centers (REC) Program provides assistance to health care providers to adopt and meaningfully use certified EHR technology. The program, funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) or The Recovery Act, provides grants to organizations, Regional Extension Centers, that assist providers directly in the organization's region. There are 62 unique RECs across the United States. This data set provides county-level health care professional participation in the REC Program. You can track metrics on the total primary care and non-primary care providers that signed up for REC assistance, gone live with an EHR, and demonstrated meaningful use of certified EHR technology. See ONC's REC data by state to track these metrics at the county level.
