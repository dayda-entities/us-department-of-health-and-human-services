2008-2021. American Lung Association. Cessation Coverage.  Medicaid data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionâ€™s Office on Smoking and Health were obtained from the State Tobacco Cessation Coverage Database, developed and administered by the American Lung Association.  Data from 2008-2012 are reported on an annual basis; beginning in 2013 data are reported on a quarterly basis.  Data include state-level information on Medicaid coverage of approved medications by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for tobacco cessation treatment; types of counseling recommended by the Public Health Service (PHS) and barriers to accessing cessation treatment. Note: Section 2502 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires all state Medicaid programs to cover all FDA-approved tobacco cessation medications as of January 1, 2014. However, states are currently in the process of modifying their coverage to come into compliance with this requirement. Data in the STATE System on Medicaid coverage of tobacco cessation medications reflect evidence of coverage that is found in documentable sources, and may not yet reflect medications covered under this requirement.
