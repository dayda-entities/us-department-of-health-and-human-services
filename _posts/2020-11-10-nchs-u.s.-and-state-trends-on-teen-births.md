This dataset assembles all final birth data for females aged 15–19, 15–17, and 18–19 for the United States and each of the 50 states.

Data are based on 100% of birth certificates filed in all 50 states. All the teen birth rates in this dashboard reflect the latest revisions to Census populations (i.e., the intercensal populations) and thus provide a consistent series of accurate rates for the past 25 years. The denominators of the teen birth rates for 1991–1999 have been revised to incorporate the results of the 2000 Census. The denominators of the teen birth rates for 2001–2009 have revised to incorporate the results of the 2010 Census.
