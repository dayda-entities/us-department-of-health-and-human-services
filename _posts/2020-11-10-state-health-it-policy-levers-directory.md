The Health IT State Policy Levers Compendium was developed by the Office of National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) in coordination with states. It is intended to support state efforts to advance interoperability and can also be used in service of delivery system reform. The Compendium includes a directory of health IT policy levers and nearly 300 examples of how states have used them. The 'Policy Levers Directory' is a list of all 32 distinct policy levers contained within the Compendium. The directory data includes descriptions for each lever, as well as policy lever uses for health IT and interoperability.
