The Health IT State Policy Levers Compendium was developed by the Office of National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) in coordination with states. It is intended to support state efforts to advance interoperability and can also be used in service of delivery system reform. The Compendium includes a directory of health IT policy levers and nearly 300 examples of how states have used them. The 'Activities Catalog' includes the over 300 documented examples of health IT policy levers in use by states. The catalog data includes the states using the policy lever to promote health IT and advance interoperability, the state's documented activities, and official information source for these activities.
