YRBSS Data. The YRBS is conducted biennially and collects data on a variety of youth risk behaviors including tobacco use. The YRBS uses a two-stage cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in high schools (grades 9-12). The YRBS uses SUDAAN to calculate asymmetric confidence intervals based on the logit transformation. The logit transformation constrains confidence interval limits to vary between a lower limit of 0% and an upper limit of 100%. The data for the STATE System were extracted from YRBSS surveys from participating states. Tobacco topics include cigarette and e-cigarette use prevalence, cigarette and e-cigarette use frequency, and smokeless tobacco products.
