Overall rates of TBI climbed slowly from 2001 through 2007, then spiked sharply in 2008 and continued to climb through 2010.  The increase in TBI rates in 2008 was much sharper for men (nearly 40% increase) than for women (20% increase).  In 2007, overall rates of TBI were 26% higher in men compared to women.  In 2008, that gap began to widen, reaching 61% in 2009 before narrowing to 29% in 2010.  Rates of overall TBI are largely driven by rates of TBI-related ED visits.
