The Medicare &amp; Medicaid Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Programs provide incentives to eligible ambulatory and inpatient providers to adopt electronic health records. This dataset provides the counts of health care providers that have reported a developer's product through participation in the Medicare EHR Incentive Program. The data are provided beginning in 2011. This dataset enables the tracking of trends in the adoption of healthIT by developer and by both office-based health care providers and non-federal acute-care hospitals. Filter the data by Program Year to get the most recent counts by health care provider type. The most recent data is available through the 2016 Program Year.
