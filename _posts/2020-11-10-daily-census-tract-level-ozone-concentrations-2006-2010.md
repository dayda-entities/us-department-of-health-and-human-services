This dataset provides modeled predictions of ozone levels from the EPA's Downscaler model. Data are at the census tract level for 2006-2010. These data are used by the CDC's National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network to generate air quality measures. Census tract-level datasets contain estimates of the mean predicted concentration and associated standard error. Please refer to the metadata attachment for more information.
