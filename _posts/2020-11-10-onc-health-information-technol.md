The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act was passed as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to invest in the U.S. health IT infrastructure. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC) received over $2 billion of these HITECH funds, which was granted to health and community organizations across the U.S. This crosswalk provides geographic data for the service areas of two of these HITECH programs: the Health IT Regional Extension Centers (REC) Program and the Beacon Communities Program. This data can be linked to program financial and performance data to map and visualize program data. You can access the data in multiple formats below.
