The BRFSS is a continuous, state-based surveillance system that collects information about modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases and other leading causes of death. The data for the STATE System were extracted from the annual BRFSS surveys from participating states. Tobacco topics included are cigarette and e-cigarette use prevalence by demographics, cigarette and e-cigarette use frequency, and quit attempts. NOTE: these data are not to be compared with BRFSS data collected 2010 and prior, as the methodologies were changed. Please refer to the FAQs / Methodology sections for more details.
