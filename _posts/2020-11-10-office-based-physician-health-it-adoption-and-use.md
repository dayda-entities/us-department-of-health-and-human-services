Since 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics has fielded a mail survey of office-based physicians, the National Electronic Health Records Survey (NEHRS). ONC helps fund this supplement to track office-based physician adoption and the use of EHRs for health information exchange and patient engagement. Starting in 2010, the NEHRS's sample size was increased to allow for state-level estimates. The data set estimates each measure nationally and individually for each state and the District of Columbia beginning in 2010, unless otherwise noted.
