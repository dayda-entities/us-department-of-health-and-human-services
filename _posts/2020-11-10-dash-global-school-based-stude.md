2003-2015. Global School dataset.  The Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS) was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with the United Nations' UNICEF, UNESCO, and UNAIDS; and with technical assistance from CDC.  The GSHS is a school-based survey conducted primarily among students aged 13-17 years in countries around the world.  It uses core questionnaire modules that address the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children and adults worldwide: 1) Alcohol use, 2) dietary behaviors, 3) drug use, 4) hygiene, 5) mental health, 6) physical activity, 7) protective factors, 8) sexual behaviors that contribute to HIV infection, other sexually-transmitted infections, and unintended pregnancy, 9) tobacco use, and 10) violence and unintentional injury.  This dataset contains global data from 2003 â€“ 2015.  Additional information about the GSHS can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/gshs/index.htm.
