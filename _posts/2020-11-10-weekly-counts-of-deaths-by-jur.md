This visualization provides weekly data on the number of deaths from all causes by jurisdiction of occurrence and race and Hispanic origin. Numbers of deaths are also shown for all causes excluding COVID-19, and for COVID-19. Counts of deaths in more recent weeks can be compared with counts from earlier years to determine if the number is higher than expected.
