The following table provides eligibility levels in each state for key coverage groups that use Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI), as of April 1, 2018. The data represent the principal, but not all, MAGI coverage groups in Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Basic Health Program (BHP). All income standards are expressed as a percentage of the federal poverty level (FPL). The MAGI-based rules generally include adjusting an individual’s income by an amount equivalent to a 5% FPL disregard. Other eligibility criteria also apply, such as citizenship, immigration status, and state residency.
