Changes in the rates of TBI-related deaths vary depending on age.  For persons 44 years of age and younger, TBI-related deaths decreased between the periods of 2001-2002 and 2009-2010.  Rates for age groups 45-64 years of age remained stable for this same ten-year period.  For persons 65 years and older, rates of TBI-related deaths increased during this time period, from 41.2 to 45.2 deaths per 100,000.Go to http://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/data/index.html to view more TBI data & statistics.Source: http://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/data/rates_deaths_byage.html
