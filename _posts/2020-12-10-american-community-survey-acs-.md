2014, 2015, 2016, 2017. This dataset is a de-identified summary table of vision and eye health data indicators from ACS, stratified by all available combinations of age group, race/ethnicity, gender, and state. ACS is an annual nationwide survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau that collects information on demographic, social, economic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population. Approximate sample size is 3 million annually. ACS data for VEHSS includes one question related to Visual Function. Data were suppressed for cell sizes less than 30 persons, or where the relative standard error more than 30% of the mean. Data will be updated as it becomes available. Detailed information on VEHSS ACS analyses can be found on the VEHSS ACS webpage (link). Additional information about ACS can be found on the U.S. Census Bureau website (https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/programs-surveys/acs/about/ACS_Information_Guide.pdf). The VEHSS ACS dataset was last updated in June 2018.
