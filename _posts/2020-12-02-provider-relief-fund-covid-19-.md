The bipartisan CARES Act; and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (PPPHCEA); and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations (CRRSA) Act provided $178 billion in relief funds to hospitals and other healthcare providers on the front lines of the coronavirus response. The Department of Health and Human Services through the Health Resources and Services Administration is allocating $2 billion in incentive payments to nursing home facilities that reduce both COVID-19 infection rates relative to their county and mortality rates against a national benchmark.
