Active drugs that have been reported by participating drug manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. All drugs are identified by National Drug Code (NDC), unit type, units per package size, product name, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval date, the date the drug entered the market, plus indicators to show whether the drug is an innovator or non-innovator drug; whether it is available by prescription or over-the-counter (OTC); the FDA therapeutic equivalency code; and the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) rating and termination date. Each quarter posted represents a snapshot of data in the system at that time and is not updated by subsequent changes.
