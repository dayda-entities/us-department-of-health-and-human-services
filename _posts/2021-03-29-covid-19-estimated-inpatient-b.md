<p>The following dataset provides state-aggregated data for <b>estimated patient impact and hospital utilization</b>.</p>
<p>The source data for estimation is derived from reports with facility-level granularity across two main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, and (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities.</p>
<p>Estimates Basis: These files are representative estimates for each state and are updated weekly. These projections are based on the information we have from those who reported. As more hospitals report more frequently our projections become more accurate. The actual data for these data points are updated every day, once a day on healthdata.gov and these are the downloadable data sets.</p>
