<p>The COVID-19 Claims Reimbursement to Health Care Providers and Facilities for Testing and Treatment of the Uninsured Program provides reimbursements on a rolling basis directly to eligible health care entities for claims that are attributed to the testing and/or treatment of COVID-19 for uninsured individuals. The program is funded via the:<br />
Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) Relief Fund, which includes funds received from the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, as appropriated in the FFCRCA (P.L. 116-127) and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (P.L. 116-139) (PPPHCEA), which each appropriated $1 billion to reimburse health care entities for conducting COVID-19 testing for the uninsured; and the Provider Relief Fund, which includes funds received from the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, as appropriated in the Coronavirus Air, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (P.L. 116-136), which provides $100 billion in relief funds, including to hospitals and other health care entities on the front lines of the COVID-19 response and the PPPHCEA to reimburse health care entities for treating uninsured individuals with a COVID-19 diagnosis.<br />
The PPPHCEA appropriated an additional $75 billion in relief funds. Within the Provider Relief Fund, a portion of the funding will be used to support healthcare-related expenses attributable to the treatment of uninsured individuals with COVID-19.<br />
Health care entities that have conducted COVID-19 testing of uninsured individuals for COVID-19 or provided treatment to uninsured individuals with a COVID-19 diagnosis on or after February 4, 2020, can request claims reimbursement through the program electronically and will be reimbursed generally at Medicare rates, subject to available funding.<br />
This dataset represents the list of health care entities who have agreed to the Terms and Conditions and received claims reimbursement for COVID-19 testing of uninsured individuals and/or treatment for uninsured individuals with a COVID-19 diagnosis, as of January 6, 2021.</p>
