The Updated Systematic Review reviews the January 2010 to August 2013 health IT literature to examine the effects of health IT across three aspects of care: efficiency, quality, and safety. This report updates previous systematic reviews of the health IT literature, focusing specifically on identifying and summarizing the evidence related to the use of health IT as outlined in the Meaningful Use regulations. The review examined the literature to determine the article authors' findings related to the effects or associations of a meaningful use functionality on an aspect of care. Each article's findings was scored as positive (defined as: health IT improved key aspect of care but none worse off), mixed-positive (defined as: positive effects of health IT outweight negative effects), neutral (defined as: health IT not associated with change in outcome), or negative (defined as: negative effects of health IT on outcome). The full review data: article, related meaningful use functionality, aspect of care, and author sentiment are provided in this dataset.
