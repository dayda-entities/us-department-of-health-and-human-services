1991-2016. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation (STATE) System.  Funding Data, Appropriations (1991-2016) and Expenditures (2008-2016).  Appropriations data show public funds allocated to/by a particular state for tobacco prevention and control.  They are not necessarily expended.  Appropriations are from four major funding sources, Federal, state, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), and the American Legacy Foundation (Legacy).  Expenditures are amounts spent by state tobacco control programs on tobacco prevention and control.  Expenditure data are available by CDC Best Practices Program Components (State and Community Interventions, Health Communication Interventions, Cessation Interventions, Surveillance and Evaluation, and Administration and Management). Expenditures from 2008 to 2014 are compared against 2007 CDC Best Practices Recommendations; expenditures from 2015 and forward are compared against 2014 CDC Best Practices Recommendations.
