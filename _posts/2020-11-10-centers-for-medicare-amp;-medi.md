The CMS EHR Incentive Programs provide incentives to eligible office-based providers and hospitals to adopt electronic health records. Both the Medicare and Medicaid programs have separate criteria and eligible participants. These measures track the percentage of physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, short-term general, Critical Access, and Children's hospitals that have demonstrated meaningul use of certified electronic health record technology and/or adopted, implemented, or ugraded any electronic health record. These measures track the rate of adoption and use of EHR technology certified by HHS in addition to adoption of other non-certified EHR technology. These measures are cumulative, representing the most recent data.
