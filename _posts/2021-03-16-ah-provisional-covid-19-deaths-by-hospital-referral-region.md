Provisional count of deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States by week of death and by hospital referral region (HRR). HRR is determined by county of occurrence. Weekly weighted counts of deaths from all causes and due to COVID-19 are provided by HRR overall and for decedents 65 years and older. The weighted counts by HRRs are based on published methods for aggregating county-level data to HRRs. More detail about aggregating to HRRs from counties can be found in the following: https://github.com/Dartmouth-DAC/covid-19-hrr-mapping
