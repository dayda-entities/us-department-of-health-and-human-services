(https://toxmap.nlm.nih.gov/toxmap/) As a subset of TOXMAP this dataset represents 2016 coal emissions published by the US EPA's Clean Air Markets program. Data was obtained from the Air Markets Program Data (AMPD) tool, a publicly-available data system for searching and downloading data collected as part of EPA's emissions trading programs.
