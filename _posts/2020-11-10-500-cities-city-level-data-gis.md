2016, 2015. Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. 500 cities project city-level data in GIS-friendly format can be joined with city spatial data (https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities/500-Cities-City-Boundaries/n44h-hy2j) in a geographic information system (GIS) to produce maps of 27 measures at the city-level. There are 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, cholesterol screening) in this 2018 release from the 2015 BRFSS that were the same as the 2017 release.
