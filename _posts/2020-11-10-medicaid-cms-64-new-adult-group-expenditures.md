This dataset reports summary level expenditure data associated with the new adult group established under the Affordable Care Act. These state expenditures are reported through the federal Medicaid Budget and Expenditure System (MBES).

Notes:
1. “VIII GROUP” is also known as the “New Adult Group.”
2. The VIII Group is only applicable for states that have expanded their Medicaid programs by adopting the VIII Group. VIII Group expenditure information
for the states that have not expanded their Medicaid program is noted as “N/A.”
3. States that have reported “0” either have no expenditures for that reporting category or have not yet reported expenditures for that category.
4. MCHIP expenditures are not included in the All Medical Assistance Expenditures.
