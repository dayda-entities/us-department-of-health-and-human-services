To support state and local communication and outreach efforts, ASPE developed state, county, and sub-state level predictions of hesitancy rates(https://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-report/vaccine-hesitancy) using the most recently available federal survey data.

We estimate hesitancy rates at the state level using the U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey (HPS)(https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey.html) data and utilize the estimated values to predict hesitancy rates in more granular areas using the Census Bureau’s 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS)(https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata.html). Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMA) level – PUMAs are geographic areas within each state that contain no fewer than 100,000 people. PUMAs can consist of part of a single densely populated county or can combine parts or all of multiple counties that are less densely populated.

The HPS is nationally representative and includes information on U.S. residents’ intentions to receive the COVID-19 vaccine when available, as well as other sociodemographic and geographic (state, region and metropolitan statistical areas) information. The ACS is a nationally representative survey, and it provides key sociodemographic and geographic (state, region, PUMAs, county) information. We utilized data for the survey collection period March 3, 2021 – March 15, 2021, which the HPS refers to as Week 26.
