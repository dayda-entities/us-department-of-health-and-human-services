The 2011 BRFSS data reflects a change in weighting methodology (raking) and the addition of cell phone only respondents. Shifts in observed prevalence from 2010 to 2011 for BRFSS measures will likely reflect the new methods of measuring risk factors, rather than true trends in risk-factor prevalence. A break in trend lines after 2010 is used to reflect this change in methodolgy. Percentages are weighted to population characteristics. Data are not available if it did not meet BRFSS stability requirements.For more information on these requirements, as well as risk factors and calculated variables, see the Technical Documents and Survey Data for a specific year - http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm.Recommended citation: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
