2017, 2016. Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. 500 cities project city-level data in GIS-friendly format can be joined with city spatial data (https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities/500-Cities-City-Boundaries/n44h-hy2j) in a geographic information system (GIS) to produce maps of 27 measures at the city-level. There are 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, Pap tests, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleep less than 7 hours) in this 2019 release from the 2016 BRFSS that were the same as the 2018 release.
