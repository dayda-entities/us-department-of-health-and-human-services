The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) EHR Incentive Program provides incentive payments for eligible hospitals to adopt and meaningfully use certified health IT. Among the requirements to receive an incentive payment, participating hospitals must report on public health measures. These measures include the electronic reporting of data regarding: immunizations, emergency department visits (syndromic surveillance), reportable infectious disease laboratory results, and electronic patient data to specialized registries, like cancert. As of 2015, stage 2 of the EHR Incentive Program requires hospitals to report on three public health measures, when applicable, and modified stage 2 of the program requires hospitals to report on two of the three measures. This dataset includes the percentage of hospitals who reported on these measures in program years, 2013, 2014 and 2015.
