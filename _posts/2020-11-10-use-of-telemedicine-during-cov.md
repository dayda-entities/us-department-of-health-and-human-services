The Research and Development Survey (RANDS) is a platform designed for conducting survey question evaluation and statistical research. RANDS is an ongoing series of surveys from probability-sampled commercial survey panels used for methodological research at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). RANDS estimates were generated using an experimental approach that differs from the survey design approaches generally used by NCHS, including possible biases from different response patterns and increased variability from lower sample sizes. Use of the RANDS platform allowed NCHS to produce more timely data than would have been possible using our traditional data collection methods. RANDS is not designed to replace NCHS’ higher quality, core data collections. Below we provide experimental estimates of telemedicine access and use for two rounds of RANDS during COVID-19. Data collection for the first round occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020 and data collection for the second round occurred between August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020. Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes.

NCHS included questions about whether providers offered telemedicine (including video and telephone appointments)—both during and before the pandemic—and about the use of telemedicine during the pandemic. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, many local and state governments discouraged people from leaving their homes for nonessential reasons. Although health care is considered an essential activity, telemedicine offers an opportunity for care without the potential or perceived risks of leaving the home. The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), conducted by NCHS, added telemedicine questions to its sample adult questionnaire in July 2020. Currently RANDS is the only NCHS source for statistics related to telemedicine availability and use.

The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS and show the percentage of U.S. adults who have a usual place of care and a provider that offered telemedicine in the past two months, who used telemedicine in the past two months, or who have a usual place of care and a provider that offered telemedicine prior to the coronavirus pandemic.
