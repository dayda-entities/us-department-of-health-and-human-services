The Current Population Survey is a monthly survey of about 50,000 households conducted by the Bureau of the Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The survey has been conducted for more than 50 years. Estimates obtained from the CPS include employment, unemployment, earnings, hours of work, and other indicators. Supplemental surveys include questions about a variety of topics, including an annual social and economic supplement, school enrollment, work schedules, voting and registration, job tenure and occupational mobility, food security, and tobacco use.

The data for the STATE System were obtained through the Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS).  Tobacco topics included are cigarette smoking status, cigarette smoking prevalence by demographics, cigarette smoking frequency, cigarette consumption, quit attempts, cigar use, pipe use, smokeless tobacco use, and smokefree rules/policies in homes and worksites.
