The Medicaid Managed Care Enrollment Report profiles enrollment statistics on Medicaid managed care programs on a plan-specific level. The managed care enrollment statistics include enrollees receiving comprehensive benefits and limited benefits and are point-in-time counts.

1. Because Medicaid beneficiaries may be enrolled concurrently in more than one type of managed care program (e.g., a Comprehensive MCO and a BHO), users should not sum enrollment across all program types, since the total would count individuals more than once and, in some states, exceed the actual number of Medicaid enrollees.

2. Comprehensive MCOs cover acute, primary, and specialty medical care services; they may also cover behavioral health, long-term services and supports, and other benefits in some states. Limited benefit managed care programs, including PCCM, MLTSS only, BHO, Dental, Transportation, and Other cover a narrower set of services.	

"--" indicates states that do not operates programs of a given type. 0 signifies that a state operated a program of this type in 2014, but it ended before July 1, 2014, or began after that date.
