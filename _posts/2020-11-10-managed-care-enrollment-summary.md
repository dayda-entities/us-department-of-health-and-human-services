<p>The Medicaid Managed Care Enrollment Report profiles enrollment statistics on Medicaid managed care programs on a plan-specific level. The managed care enrollment statistics include enrollees receiving comprehensive benefits and limited benefits and are point-in-time counts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Total Medicaid Enrollees represents an unduplicated count of all beneficiaries in FFS and any type of managed care, including Medicaid-only and Medicare-Medicaid ("dual") enrollees.</li>
<li>Total Medicaid enrollment in Any Type of Managed Care represents an unduplicated count of beneficiaries enrolled in any Medicaid managed care program, including comprehensive MCOs, limited benefit MCOs, and PCCMs.</li>
<li>Medicaid Enrollment in Comprehensive Managed Care represents an unduplicated count of Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in a managed care plan that provides comprehensive benefits (acute, primary care, specialty, and any other), as well as PACE programs. It excludes beneficiaries who are enrolled in a Financial Alignment Initiative Medicare-Medicaid Plan as their only form of managed care.</li>
<li>Medicaid Newly Eligible Adults Enrolled in Comprehensive MCOs represents individuals who are enrolled in comprehensive MCOs and are low-income adults, with or without dependent children, newly eligible for Medicaid under ACA Section VIII, and not covered under a waiver or other authority prior to 2014.</li>
