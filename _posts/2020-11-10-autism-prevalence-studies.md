<p>This data table provides a collection of information from peer-reviewed autism prevalence studies. Information reported from each study includes the autism prevalence estimate and additional study characteristics (e.g., case ascertainment and criteria). A PubMed search was conducted to identify studies published at any time through September 2020 using the search terms: autism (title/abstract) OR autistic (title/abstract) AND prevalence (title/abstract). Data were abstracted and included if the study fulfilled the following criteria:<br />
•   The study was published in English;<br />
•   The study produced at least one autism prevalence estimate; and<br />
•   The study was population-based (any age range) within a defined geographic area.</p>
