1999-2008; 2005-2008. This dataset is a de-identified summary table of vision and eye health data indicators from NHANES, stratified by all available combinations of age group, race/ethnicity, gender, and risk factor. NHANES is a program of studies conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics at CDC designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the U.S, and combines interviews and physical examinations. NHANES stopped collecting vision and eye health data in 2008. Approximate sample size is 5,000 persons per year. NHANES data for VEHSS includes questions and examinations related to Visual Function, Vision Exam Measures, Eye Health Conditions, Service Utilization, and Examination Measures. Data were suppressed for cell sizes less than 30 persons, or where the relative standard error more than 30% of the mean. Detailed information on VEHSS NHANES analyses can be found on the VEHSS NHANES webpage (https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/vehss/data/national-surveys/national-health-and-nutrition-examination-survey.html). Additional information about NHANES can be found on the NHANES website (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm). The VEHSS NHANES dataset was last updated in June 2018.
