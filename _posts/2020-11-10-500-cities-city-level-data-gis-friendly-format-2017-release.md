2015, 2014. Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. 500 cities project census city-level data in GIS-friendly format can be joined with city spatial data (https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities/500-Cities-City-Boundaries/n44h-hy2j) in a geographic information system (GIS) to produce maps of 27 measures at the city-level. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS, there are 7 measures in this 2017 release from the 2014 BRFSS that were the same as the 2016 release.
