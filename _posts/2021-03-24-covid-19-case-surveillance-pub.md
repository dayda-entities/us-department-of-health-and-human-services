This case surveillance public use dataset has 19 elements for all COVID-19 cases shared with CDC and includes demographics, geography (county and state of residence), any exposure history, disease severity indicators and outcomes, and presence of any underlying medical conditions and risk behaviors.

Currently, CDC provides the public with three versions of COVID-19 case surveillance line-listed data: this <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4">19 data element dataset with geography</a>, a <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf">12 data element public use dataset</a>, and a <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Restricted-Access-Detai/mbd7-r32t">32 data element restricted access dataset</a>.

The following apply to the public use datasets and the restricted access dataset:
- Data elements can be found on the COVID-19 case report form located at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/pui-form.pdf">www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/pui-form.pdf</a>.
- Data are considered provisional by CDC and are subject to change until the data are reconciled and verified with the state and territorial data providers.
- Some data are suppressed to protect individual privacy.
- Datasets will include all cases with the earliest date available in each record (date received by CDC or date related to illness/specimen collection) at least 14 days prior to the creation of the previously updated datasets. This 14-day lag allows case reporting to be stabilized and ensure that time-dependent outcome data are accurately captured.
- Datasets are updated monthly.
- Datasets are created using CDCâ€™s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/maso/policy/policy385.pdf">Policy on Public Health Research and Nonresearch Data Management and Access</a> and include protections designed to protect individual privacy.

<b>Overview</b>

The COVID-19 case surveillance database includes patient-level data reported by U.S. states and autonomous reporting entities, including New York City and the District of Columbia (D.C.), as well as U.S. territories and affiliates. On April 5, 2020, COVID-19 was added to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/">Nationally Notifiable Condition List</a> and classified as "immediately notifiable, urgent (within 24 hours)" by a Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) Interim Position Statement (<a href="https://www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID-19_NO.pdf">Interim-20-ID-01</a>). CSTE updated the position statement on August 5, 2020 to clarify the interpretation of antigen detection tests and serologic test results within the case classification (<a href="https://www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-02_COVID-19.pdf">Interim-20-ID-02</a>). The statement also recommended that all states and territories enact laws to make COVID-19 reportable in their jurisdiction, and that jurisdictions conducting surveillance should submit case notifications to CDC. COVID-19 case surveillance data collected by jurisdictions are shared voluntarily with CDC.
