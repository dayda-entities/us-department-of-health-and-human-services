2016. This dataset is a de-identified summary table of vision and eye health data indicators from VSP, stratified by all available combinations of age group, race/ethnicity, gender, and state. VSP claims for VEHSS provides a convenience sample of vision insurance members representing approximately more than 1 in 4 of the U.S. population. VSP uses a web-based claims submissions system to collect and process claims. The denominator of the rates represents persons with VSP benefits as reported by employers, and is subject to some uncertainty.  VSP data for VEHSS include Service Utilization and Eye Health Condition indicators.  Certain ophthalmic conditions and procedures are covered by health insurance and are not covered by managed vision insurance, claims based eye disease prevalence may therefore be expected to undercount true prevalence.  Person level claims and person counts are not publically available.  Reported rates were suppressed for de-identification to ensure protection of patient privacy. Detailed information on VEHSS VSP analyses can be found on the VEHSS VSP webpage (link). Information on VSP data can be found on the VSP website (www.vsp.com). The VEHSS VSP dataset was last updated in June 2018.
