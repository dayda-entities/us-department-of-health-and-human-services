<p>This dataset provides data at the county level for the contiguous United States. It includes daily Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Population-Weighted Ultraviolet (UV) irradiance data from October 2004-2015 provided by the Environmental Remote Sensing group at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University. Please refer to the metadata attachment for more information.</p>
<p>These data are used by the CDC's National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network to generate sunlight and UV measures. Learn more about sunlight and UV on the Tracking Network's website: <a href="https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showUVLanding">https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showUVLanding</a>.</p>
