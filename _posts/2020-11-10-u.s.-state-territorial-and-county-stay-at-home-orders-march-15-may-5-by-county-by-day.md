State, territorial, and county executive orders, administrative orders, resolutions, and proclamations are collected from government websites and cataloged and coded using Microsoft Excel by one coder with one or more additional coders conducting quality assurance.

Data were collected to determine when individuals in states, territories, and counties were subject to executive orders, administrative orders, resolutions, and proclamations for COVID-19 that require or recommend people stay in their homes.

These data are derived from the publicly available state, territorial, and county executive orders, administrative orders, resolutions, and proclamations (“orders”) for COVID-19 that expressly require or recommend individuals stay at home found by the CDC, COVID-19 Community Intervention and At-Risk Task Force, Monitoring and Evaluation Team & CDC, Center for State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial Support, Public Health Law Program from March 15 through May 5, 2020. These data will be updated as new orders are collected. Any orders not available through publicly accessible websites are not included in these data. Only official copies of the documents or, where official copies were unavailable, official press releases from government websites describing requirements were coded; news media reports on restrictions were excluded. Recommendations not included in an order are not included in these data. These data do not include mandatory business closures, curfews, or limitations on public or private gatherings. These data do not necessarily represent an official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
