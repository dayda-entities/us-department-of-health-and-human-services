2016-17 merged. This dataset is a de-identified summary table of vision and eye health data indicators from the National Survye of Chilrens Health (NSCH), stratified by all available combinations of age group, race/ethnicity, gender, risk factor and state. NSCH is a telephone survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics at CDC (currently conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau) that examines the physical and emotional health of children 0-17 years of age. Approximate sample size is 95,000 over two rounds of data collection. Data were suppressed for cell sizes less than 30 persons, or where the relative standard error more than 30% of the mean. Detailed information on VEHSS NSCH analyses can be found on the VEHSS NSCH webpage (cdc.gov/visionhealth/vehss/data/national-surveys/national-survey-of-childrens-health.html). Additional information about NSCH can be found on the NSCH website (http://childhealthdata.org/learn/NSCH). The VEHSS NSCH dataset was last updated in November 2019.
