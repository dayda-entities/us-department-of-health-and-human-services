Electronic prescribing (eRx) is a key component of the meaningful use of health IT to improve health care quality and lower costs. This dataset includes national and state eRx and health information exchange activity by community pharmacies and office-based health care providers active through the Surescripts Network. Surescripts is a health information network, and ONC procured electronic prescribing activity data conducted within its network from December 2008 through April 2014. The Surescripts network is used by the majority of all U.S. community pharmacies to rout prescriptions, excluding closed systems such as Kaiser Permanente. These include chain, franchise, and independently owned pharmacies. Data for annual percentages of new and renewal prescriptions routed through the Surescripts network exclude controlled substances. You may view more information about Surescripts, contact the company, and access more network data through the company's official site.
