Data from BRFSS for indicators of adult oral health for 1999 and even years from 2002 through 2010. National estimates are represented by the median prevalence among 50 states and the District of Columbia data. Estimates are prepared from the BRFSS public use data sets. Estimates in this file are not age adjusted, and may differ slightly from estimates available from the BRFSS web site or Chronic Disease Indicators due to small differences in definition, age adjustment or rounding.
