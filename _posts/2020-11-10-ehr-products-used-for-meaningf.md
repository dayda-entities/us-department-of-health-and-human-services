The Medicare Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Program provides incentives to eligible clinicians and hospitals to adopt electronic health records. This dataset combines meaningful use attestations from the Medicare EHR Incentive Program and certified health IT product data from the ONC Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL) to identify the unique vendors, products, and product types of each certified health IT product used to attest to meaningful use. The dataset also includes important provider-specific data, related to the provider&apos;s participation and status in the program, unique provider identifiers, and other characteristics unique to each provider, like geography and provider type.
