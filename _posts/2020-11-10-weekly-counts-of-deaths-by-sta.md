Final counts of deaths by the week the deaths occurred, by state of occurrence, and by select causes of death for 2014-2019.  Death counts in this dataset were derived from the National Vital Statistics System database that provides the most timely access to the data.  Therefore, counts may differ slightly from final data due to differences in processing, recoding, and imputation.
