This case surveillance public use dataset has 12 elements for all COVID-19 cases shared with CDC and includes demographics, any exposure history, disease severity indicators and outcomes, presence of any underlying medical conditions and risk behaviors, and no geographic data.
<br>
<h4><b>CDC has three COVID-19 case surveillance datasets:</b></h4>

-	<a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4">COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Data with Geography</a>: Public use, patient-level dataset with clinical data (including symptoms), demographics, and county and state of residence. (19 data elements) <br>
-	<a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf">COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Data</a>: Public use, patient-level dataset with clinical and symptom data and demographics, with no geographic data. (12 data elements)<br>
-	<a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Restricted-Access-Detai/mbd7-r32t">COVID-19 Case Surveillance Restricted Access Detailed Data</a>: Restricted access, patient-level dataset with clinical and symptom data, demographics, and state and county of residence. Access requires a registration process and a data use agreement. (32 data elements)

The following apply to all three datasets:

- Data elements can be found on the COVID-19 case report form located at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/pui-form.pdf">www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/pui-form.pdf</a>.<br>
- Data are considered provisional by CDC and are subject to change until the data are reconciled and verified with the state and territorial data providers.
- Some data cells are suppressed to protect individual privacy.<br>
- The datasets will include all cases with the earliest date available in each record (date received by CDC or date related to illness/specimen collection) at least 14 days prior to the creation of the previously updated datasets. This 14-day lag allows case reporting to be stabilized and ensures that time-dependent outcome data are accurately captured.<br>
- Datasets are updated monthly. <br>
- Datasets are created using CDC’s operational Policy on Public Health Research and Nonresearch Data Management and Access and include protections designed to protect individual privacy.<br>

<h4><b>Overview</b></h4>

The COVID-19 case surveillance database includes individual-level data reported to U.S. states and autonomous reporting entities, including New York City and the District of Columbia (D.C.), as well as U.S. territories and affiliates. On April 5, 2020, COVID-19 was added to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/"> Nationally Notifiable Condition List </a> and classified as “immediately notifiable, urgent (within 24 hours)” by a Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) Interim Position Statement (Interim-20-ID-01). CSTE updated the position statement on August 5, 2020 to clarify the interpretation of antigen detection tests and serologic test results within the case classification. The statement also recommended that all states and territories enact laws to make COVID-19 reportable in their jurisdiction, and that jurisdictions conducting surveillance should submit case notifications to CDC. COVID-19 case surveillance data are collected by jurisdictions and reported voluntarily to CDC.
