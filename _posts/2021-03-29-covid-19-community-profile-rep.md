The Community Profile Report (CPR) â€“ County-Level is generated by the Data Strategy and Execution Workgroup in the Joint Coordination Cell, under the White House COVID-19 Team. It is managed by an interagency team with representatives from multiple agencies and offices (including the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, and the Indian Health Service). 

This data table provides county-level information. It is a daily snapshot in time that focuses on recent COVID-19 outcomes in the last seven days and changes relative to the week prior. Data in this report may differ from data on state and local websites. This may be due to differences in how data were reported (e.g., date specimen obtained, or date reported for cases) or how the metrics are calculated. Historical data may be updated over time due to delayed reporting.
