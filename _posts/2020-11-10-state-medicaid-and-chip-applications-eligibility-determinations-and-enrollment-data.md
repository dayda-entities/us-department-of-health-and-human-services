All states (including the District of Columbia) are required to provide data to The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) on a range of indicators related to key application, eligibility, and enrollment processes within the state Medicaid and Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Programs (CHIP). These data reflect enrollment activity for all populations receiving comprehensive Medicaid and CHIP benefits in all states, as well as state program performance.
