1991-2017. Middle School Dataset. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health behaviors 
among youth and young adults: 1) behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; 2) tobacco use; 3) alcohol and 
other drug use; 4) sexual behaviors related to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; 5) unhealthy dietary behaviors; and 6) physical inactivity. In addition, YRBSS monitors 
the prevalence of obesity and asthma and other priority health behaviors.
