This dataset contains policy data for 50 US states and DC from 2001 to 2017. Data include information related to state legislation and regulations on nutrition, physical activity, and obesity in settings such as early care and education centers, restaurants, schools, work places, and others. To identify individual bills, use the identifier ProvisionID.  A bill or citation may appear more than once because it could apply to multiple health or policy topics, settings, or states. As of Q 2 2016, data include only enacted legislation.
