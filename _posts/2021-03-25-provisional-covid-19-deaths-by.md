Provisional COVID-19 deaths by urbanicity and week. Deaths are based on the county of occurrence in the United States. Urbanicity is defined as metropolitan and non-metropolitan, based on the 2013 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties. Counties are classified as “metropolitan” if they are large central metro, large fringe metro, medium metro or small metro; and “non-metropolitan” if micropolitan or non-core.
