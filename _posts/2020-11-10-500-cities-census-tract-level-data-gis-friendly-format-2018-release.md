2016, 2015. Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. 500 cities project census tract-level data in GIS-friendly format can be joined with census tract spatial data (https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities/500-Cities-Census-Tract-Boundaries/x7zy-2xmx) in a geographic information system (GIS) to produce maps of 27 measures at the census tract level. There are 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, cholesterol screening) in this 2018 release from the 2015 BRFSS that were the same as the 2017 release.
