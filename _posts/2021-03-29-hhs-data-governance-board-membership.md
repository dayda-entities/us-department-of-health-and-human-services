The purpose of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) Data Governance Board (DGB) is to serve as the Department’s principal data governance forum and decision-making body for managing HHS’ data as a strategic asset and to support HHS in meeting its mission and agency priorities, including implementation of the Evidence Act.

The HHS DGB currently meets <b>monthly</b> to support these activities.

This dataset serves to communicate to the public the members of the HHS DGB, as required by the Federal Data Strategy.
